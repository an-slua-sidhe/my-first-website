## This is SPARTA!!!

#### No sorry, this is

# MY VERY FIRST WEB PAGE

##### This project is a beginners website, and as such is fairly basic in its construction and execution.
##### It is, essentially, a series of links to Wikipedia explanations of well know IT resources.
##### These resouces include coding languages, coding libraries, website templates sites and versioning software.
##### The website uses HTML 5 and CSS to create a simple but non-cluttered layout.
##### This consists of 3 separate web pages, each with 6 images & links to information about various IT technologies.
##### This README is included to show the students familiarity with the annotation technology Markup.

#### I've added this at the end to see if I set up my remote repo properly.
